### Tittle: Body fat Prediction using ML
#### Dataset:
Lists estimates of the percentage of body fat determined by underwater weighing and various body circumference measurements for 257 men.
### Motive:
We can Find body Fat using DXA scan or Underwater weighing test, using this we can find density and Apply it Siris equation,
but both of them highly Expensive all are above $150, and in India DXA scan costs in range of 6000rs-15000rs,to eliminate highly Expensive Method 
to find body fat ,I tried to build an accurate method at no cost and simple in Home, using Ml Model.
